# keyword-enrichment-pathway-analysis
A framework for performing keyword enrichment and biological pathway analysis based on gene sets, text mining, or functional annotations.
# Keyword Enrichment & Pathway Analysis

This repository provides a framework for performing enrichment analysis of keywords or biological terms in gene sets, and mapping them to known biological pathways.

## 🔍 Purpose

- Identify overrepresented biological processes, pathways, or terms in a gene or keyword list.
- Map significant keywords to KEGG, Reactome, or GO pathways.
- Visualize enriched terms and networks.

## 🚀 Features

- Term/gene set overrepresentation analysis (ORA)
- Support for KEGG, Reactome, GO annotations
- Custom text-based keyword enrichment (e.g., PubMed abstracts)
- Visualizations: bar plots, dot plots, enrichment maps

## 📁 Structure

- `data/`: Input gene lists, annotations, keyword files
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for enrichment and plotting
- `results/`: Output tables and statistics
- `figures/`: Final publication-quality plots
- `docs/`: Documentation and notes

## ⚙️ Setup

### Using pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
